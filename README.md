# 🌟 Enhanced Salesforce Roles

Large Salesforce projects that consist of a lot of user roles configured can be quite challenging for Salesforce developers and admins who need a holistic view using the default Salesforce role interface.

Since the "expand all" feature doesn't work for orgs with more than 1000 roles, manually selecting and expanding each role one by one becomes a tedious process. 😓 Unfortunately, there is no out-of-the-box feature or readily available hack to address this situation.

Introducing this app! 🚀 It's designed to provide a quick fix for developers and admins dealing with this issue.

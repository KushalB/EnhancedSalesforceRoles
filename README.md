# Enhanced Salesforce Roles

Large Salesforce Projects that consist of a lot of user roles configured, it is quite difficult as a Saleforce developer or an Admin to use the default salesforce role interface to get a holistic view.

Since the expand all feature doesn't work for orgs having more than 1000 roles, we have to select and expand each roles one by one and there is no out of the box feature or readily available hack that can help in the situation

So this app is for devs and admins who are dealing with this issue and looking for a quick fix.
